### About
My friend Caleb and I are working on this for development experience and for fun.

Just testing it out:
<p><a title="Fabric Language Kotlin" href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric-language-kotlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/c1DH9VL.png" alt="" width="171" height="50" /></a></p>

## Plans
- [x] Base item (Pure prismarine)
- [x] Cool blocks
- [x] Generating ores
- [x] Nice tools
- [ ] Nice armour
- [ ] Cool dungeons
- [ ] A status effect that inhibits motion in water (possibly called aquaphobia?)
- [ ] Dungeon gate and dimension?!
- [ ] A story?!Â¿?1!
